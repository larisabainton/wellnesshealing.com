                text: "<p>The lymphatic system cleanses toxins from the body, drains excess fluids, and helps maintain a healthy immune system. Poor lymphatic circulation (caused by surgery, trauma, infection, stress, inherited dysfunction, or aging) can result in a range of related medical conditions and illnesses.</p><p>Lymphatic therapy treats these issues by restoring healthy lymphatic circulation. The goal is to remove previously stagnant lymphatic fluids, kickstart the immune system, and give balance to the body's autonomic nervous system.</p><p>The entire process is non-invasive, relaxing, extremely gentle, and a key preventive measure, thus contributing to prolonged good health. Practitioners of this technique gently palpate at key points of the body to determine the state of lymphatic circulation. They evaluate for poor flow, and with treatment, encourage the proper rhythm, direction, strength, and quality of lymphatic flow. More than eighty years of research have shown the benefits of lymphatic therapy.</p><p>Valerie Bainton, P.T. is extensively trained in both Dr. Vodder's Manual Lymph DrainageTM (MLD) and Dr. Chikly's Lymph Drainage TherapyTM (LDT).</p>",
